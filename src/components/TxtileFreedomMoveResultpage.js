                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>The Indian subcontinent was recognized as a commercial zone of vital importance in the ancient times as revealed through the evidence of early Indian trade since nearly three and a half millennium years ago. Trade and crafts are the developments of surplus agricultural production which was noticed in India for the first time with the rise of urban centres in the Indus Valley Civilisation (2600-1900 BCE).</p>
                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>From the earliest times, Indian trade flourished in all forms, be it limited internal (domestic) or long distance external trade and be it through land or water. The Harappans have been well recognized as accomplished sea-farers as evidenced by depiction of boats on seals, tablets or amulets.</p>
                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>The dockyard discovered at Lothal in Gujarat is a very sound evidence of maritime trade being practiced during that time. Harappans established contact with Oman, Bahrain and other places in west Asia.</p>

                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>There is evidence that maritime trade continued on a major scale in the Vedic (1500-800 BCE), Mauryan (c. 324-187 BCE), Kushana (circa 30 CE-circa 375) and Gupta periods (3rd century CE-543 CE) and also in the subsequent periods of south Indian dynasties like Pallavas, Chalukyas and Cholas. “May our ship embark to all quarters of the earth” is mentioned as the motto of Rig Vedic seafarers.</p>

                    Similarly, Buddhist literature, including Jataka stories, are also replete with the accounts of sea voyages, shipwrecks and missionaries going overseas. There were feeder land routes for bringing goods from the point of their production to the points of export i.e. sea ports and vice versa. The feeder land routes acted as supporting collection as well as distribution channels during trade.</p>

                    txtile-coloper-Textiles have consistently been one of the key items of Indian trade ever since the Harappan period. Like many other materials of perishable nature, txtile-coloper-textiles as trade items do not survive as evidence but the few available ones are enough to speak volumes about its commerce. Evidence of txtile-coloper-textile trade is sometimes implicit in other sources. For instance, the scroll headdress on a clay figurine from Harappa very closely resembles the symbol of a Babylonian goddess which hints at trading relations between the two territories. Babylon was a city in ancient Mesopotamia (present day parts of Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey).</p>
                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>
                    There are references that clothes, along with other items like medicinal plants, incense, fragrance materials, etc. were regularly sent to Mesopotamia from the eastern countries of Meluhha which was the Sumerian name for Indus civilization.</p>

                <p className='txtile-coloper-resultp'>These items continued to be in trade in subsequent periods also. Atharva Veda indicates that a kind of woollen cloth called dursha formed an article of trade. The Periplus of the Erythrean sea, a manual written in 1st century CE by a Greek for the mariners trading between Red Sea and Bay of Bengal, also refers to trading of clothes from India. This book talks about very fine quality muslins (cotton fabric of plain weave ranging from sheers to coarse sheets) as an item of export of the Ganga or Vanga country. This was probably from Tamluk (ancient Tamralipti) port in Purbi Medinipur district and Chandraketugarh in 24 Pargana district of West Bengal.</p>
